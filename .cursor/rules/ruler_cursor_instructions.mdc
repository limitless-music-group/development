## Database Commands

All database operations should be run from the server workspace:

- `pnpm migrate` - Run database migrations and push schema changes to database
- `pnpm dev:studio` - Open database studio
- `pnpm generate` - Generate Prisma files

Database schema is located in `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`

## API Structure

- oRPC endpoints are in `packages/core-service/routers`
- Client-side API utils are in `apps/web/src/utils/api.ts`

## Adding More Features

You can add additional addons or deployment options to your project using:

```bash
pnpx create-better-t-stack
add
```

Available addons you can add:

- **Documentation**: Starlight, Fumadocs
- **Linting**: Biome, Oxlint, Ultracite
- **Other**: Ruler, Turborepo, PWA, Tauri, Husky

You can also add web deployment configurations like Cloudflare Workers support.

## Project Configuration

This project includes a `bts.jsonc` configuration file that stores your Better-T-Stack settings:

- Contains your selected stack configuration (database, ORM, backend, frontend, etc.)
- Used by the CLI to understand your project structure
- Safe to delete if not needed
- Updated automatically when using the `add` command

## Key Points

- This is a Turborepo monorepo using pnpm workspaces
- Each app has its own `package.json` and dependencies
- Run commands from the root to execute across all workspaces
- Run workspace-specific commands with `pnpm run command-name`
- Turborepo handles build caching and parallel execution
- Use `pnpx
create-better-t-stack add` to add more features later
